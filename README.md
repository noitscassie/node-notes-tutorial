# Node Notes App

This is the back-end to a notes app, built using Node. It has been built by following this [tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/building-a-simple-node-js-api-in-under-30-minutes-a07ea9e390d2).


To document: issues with the POST request failing over two days. Learned about version issues, changing syntax. Reading error messages properly - thought stuff on mLab side was fine as I connected to the database, but it was the the database that the POST request was targetting, rather than connecting to, that was the problem. Learned how to interact with mongoDB in the command line.
